# Poisson

Poisson is a frequency calculator (the name implies nothing, I needed something, I chosed Poisson). You open the app and hit "Tap" once a given event occur. The app will display elapsed time in between the last tap and the one you did. 

This app was made for my girlfriend to help her calculate her contractions when she'll start her labor. We'll see how it goes...
